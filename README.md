# Game Instructions

## How to Access Game
Open the project in IntelliJ IDE. Run the DungeonAdventure class's main method.

## Starting Out
When you launch the game, it asks you for your character name and then to select your class by clicking one of three buttons. Once you create your character, you are shown the map and ready to play!

## Screen Layout
Top left - The Dungeon Map
Top Right - Character Name, Health
Middle Right - Room Map
Bottom Left - Information panel
Bottom Right - Inventory (tracks your pillars of OO)

## Symbols On the Dungeon and Room Maps
@ - represents the player's location on the map
e - entrance to the dungeon
^ - exit from the dungeon (go here when you have all the pillars to win!)
h - represents a healing potion
v - represents a vision potion
A - represents the pillar of Abstraction
E - represents the pillar of Encapsulation
I - represents the pillar of Inheritance
P - represents the pillar of Polymorphism
X - represents a pit. OH NO!
[|] - Door (east or west)
[-] - Door (north or south)

## Controls
Once the map is shown, move the player's location using W, A, S, and D keys.

## Monsters
Rooms can have monsters. You can't pick up a useful item or pillar in a room with a monster until the monster is defeated.
